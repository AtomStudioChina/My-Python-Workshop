# My-Python-Workshop
Some useful Python programs.
Made in CHINA.

How to use this?
>In 数据可视化/dice, run all the files except die.py (just a module). Run the svg files to look at the analysed results.
>In 数据可视化/pictures, the random_walk.py is just a module, you will get nohing if you run it, and run other files to see the beautiful pictures.

Because I'm not always good, so maybe there will be some BUGS, I'll fix it if you tell me😊
