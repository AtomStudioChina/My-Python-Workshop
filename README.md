# My-Python-Workshop
Some useful Python programs.
Made in CHINA.

How to use this?

>In ASCII转换器:
		>Run ASCII.py.

>In 下载第三方库:
		>Use os安装.py or pip main自动安装.py to download the common ones.
		>Use pipdata.txt批量下载.py to download the ones in the pipdata.txt. I have already provided some.
		>pip自动升级第三方库.py will update your goodies!
		>卸载.py can uninstall the terrible ones you don't need (just type the name of it and press Enter).
		>原版下载检索版.py or 高速下载检索版.py can download the ones quickly instead of typing "pip install ...". Just type the name of the one you want to download and Enter.原版下载检索版.py is the ones from python original; 高速下载检索版.py is good for Chinese friends, you can download it quicker, you can change the way (4 in all) in 高速下载检索版.py.

>In 地图:
	>Choose one of them to run. You can see the .html file in the folder.
	>Now there's only 2D maps, and I am going to update the 3D maps.

>In 数据可视化:
		>In dice, run all the files except die.py (just a module). Run the .svg files to look at the analysed results.
		>In pictures, the random_walk.py is just a module, you will get nohing if you run it, and run other files to see the beautiful pictures.

Because I'm not always doing good, so maybe there will be some BUGS, I'll fix it if you tell me😊
